# Legacy Build Samples – Anupam Tripathi

This repository is a curated collection of code snippets, prototypes, and solution components built over the course of 15+ years. These samples were developed using various languages and tools such as Python, SQL (Oracle/PostgreSQL/SQL Server), SAS, Excel, and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP).

---

## Purpose

This repo serves as a **portfolio reference** and **knowledge base** for demonstrating:
- How problems were approached across analytics, marketing automation, and data engineering
- The thought process behind building scalable, data-driven solutions
- Evolution of hands-on work from early desktop scripts to full-stack cloud deployments

---

## Structure

The repo is organized by purpose and language:

- `/AI-ML` – Machine learning experiments, keyword tools, embedding search, etc.
- `/Python` – ETL jobs, keyword crawlers, address standardization, utilities
- `/SQL` – Oracle/PostgreSQL queries, procedures, and data prep logic
- `/SAS` – Legacy SAS programs used in marketing response models and segmentation
- `/Excel` – Workbooks with marketing models, forecasting logic, data crunching
- `/ReactApps` – Frontend prototypes using React + Flask backend
